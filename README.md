This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Things UI can do:

- On first render it should see the list of the first 20 pokemons loaded by PokeAPI and you can scroll down in order to load more.
- You can Select a pokemon on the pokemon list in order to see the details of it.
- Once the Pokemon Detail has loaded you can see the information about its name, weight, height, order, evolutions, stats, abilities, description, types and moves.
- You can either scroll through the list of moves and select any element of that list that it would show the detail of the move on the move detail screen. You can also navigate through the move detail screen.

## Things to improve

Due the time limitation there are a list of things I would improve.

- Loading and error messaging

- Testing and test coverage including adding automation tests

- Sort functionality and language would be an easy and a quick change.
- Improve UI as this one was inspired in my previous project
  [pokereact](https://github.com/Manny91/pokereact) ([pokereact live demo](https://master.d34nfmwcg7jwfz.amplifyapp.com/))
- Make it work better on smaller devices as the current one works but design its not the best.

- Add [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/guides/guide-react/) to the project.
